# Project Gutenberg NLP - Analyzing Frequencies of Words in English Novels

## Summary

In this project, I am analyzing the frequencies of words in Novels. The dataset used in this project consists of texts of novels from [gutenberg.org](gutenberg.org), a library of over 60,000 free eBooks. 

## Data Questions

The data questions that we try to answer with this project are:

- What are the most frequent words in *Moby Dick*?
- How often do those words occur?

## Approach

Here is the overall process I took for this project:

- State our questions
- Scrap the novel's texts from [gutenberg.org](gutenberg.org)
- Wrangle and clean the dataset
- Apply Natural Language Processing on textual data
- Apply data visualizations to look at the frequencies of words
